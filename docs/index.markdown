## Hello, I'm Jonathan Beck

I have been a professional software engineer since 2007 and have had the opportunity to work across a diverse set of project sizes and business sectors. This includes working for startups and larger organizations in FinTech, Medical Device Development, as well as former work in the Defense Sector. 

I am currently looking for new opportunities to work and collaborate in the fields of AI/ML, Custom Software Development, and Web3/Distributed Ledger technologies.

I specialize in:

- AI-integrated solutions utilizing Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta AI platforms
- AI-assisted, cloud-native, full stack software architecture and development
- Web3, Blockchain, Hashgraph, and Distributed Ledger development
- SQL and NoSQL data engineering, storage, and integrations

You can learn more about my professional background on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbeckme/).

## Bitflection LLC is my company

Bitflection LLC is the company I own and founded in 2016 for contract work as well as the business entity under which I publish applications/solutions. While Bitflection has largely remained dormant in the past few years, I am excited to be back working on rebuilding the company, offerings, and solutions.

Feel free to reach out to me at [info@bitflection.com](mailto:info@bitflection.com) or [contact@jbeck.me](mailto:contact@jbeck.me) for more information.
